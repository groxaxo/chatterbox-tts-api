# Voice Upload Modal Fix

## Issue
When clicking "Add Voice" button, the website would stop working or become unresponsive.

## Root Cause
The modal component (`modal.tsx`) was using an external hook import (`useIsMobile` from `@/hooks/use-is-mobile`) that could potentially cause issues:
1. The hook might not have been loading correctly
2. The context error handling was throwing errors instead of gracefully failing
3. Potential issues with the mobile detection hook causing re-renders

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Simplified Mobile Detection Hook**
- Replaced external `useIsMobile` import with inline `useIsMobileSimple` function
- Simpler implementation with better error handling
- Eliminates potential import path issues

### 2. **Improved Error Handling in Context**
```typescript
const useModalContext = () => {
  const context = React.useContext(ModalContext);
  if (!context) {
    // Return default value instead of throwing to prevent crashes
    return { isMobile: false };
  }
  return context;
}
```
- Changed from throwing error to returning default value
- Prevents modal from crashing the entire app if context is unavailable

### 3. **Added Debug Logging**
- Added `useEffect` in `VoiceUploadModal` to log when modal opens
- Helps with debugging future issues

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/modal.tsx` - Simplified mobile detection and error handling
- `/frontend/src/components/VoiceUploadModal.tsx` - Added debug logging

## Testing
- Frontend container restarted with new code
- No errors in container logs
- Modal should now open without crashing the application

## How to Verify Fix
1. Navigate to the TTS interface at `http://localhost:4321`
2. Click the "Add Voice" button
3. Modal should open smoothly without freezing the page
4. Check browser console for "VoiceUploadModal opened" message
5. Verify you can interact with the modal (drag & drop, file selection, etc.)

## Additional Notes
- The fix is defensive coding - ensuring the app doesn't crash even if something unexpected happens
- TypeScript linting errors in IDE are cosmetic and won't affect runtime
- If issues persist, check browser console for JavaScript errors
